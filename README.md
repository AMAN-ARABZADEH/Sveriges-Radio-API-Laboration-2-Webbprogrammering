# Sveriges-Radio-API-Laboration-2-Webbprogrammering

This was a University laboratory in course Webprogramming using  JavaScript AJAX, HTML, CSS,  to fetch data from external Server. 
I'm using Sveriges Radio API for feching data. In this moment I fetch Open source data to creat a radio site for the users to listen to, 
and displaying a simple radio for the user to listen to. 
The user can listen to 34 different radio channals + see the title , description and see prev, currecnt, next song if available at that time.
The user can also search from the option menue and see the schedual for that specific program.
