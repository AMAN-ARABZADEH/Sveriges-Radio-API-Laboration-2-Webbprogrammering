# Sveriges-Radio-API-Laboration-2-Webbprogrammering

This was a University laboratory in course Web programming using  JavaScript AJAX, HTML, CSS,  to fetch data from external Server. 
I'm using Sveriges Radio API for fetching data. In this moment I fetch Open source data to create a radio site for the users to listen to, 
and displaying a simple radio for the user to listen to. 
The user can listen to 34 different radio channels + see the title , description and see prev, current, next song if available at that time.
The user can also search from the option menu and see the schedule for that specific program.
